-----------||     In-Class Exercises: Introducing CTEs     ||--------------------------

-- Exercise 1: Baseline (No CTEs)
--
-- Task:
-- For each order, compute the total quantity of items ordered.
--
-- Requirements:
--   • Use the LINEITEM table
--   • Group by L_ORDERKEY
--
-- Display the following columns:
--   L_ORDERKEY,
--   Total_Quantity   -- sum of L_QUANTITY for that order
--
-- Order the results by L_ORDERKEY.





-- Exercise 2: The same query, but this time as a CTE
--
-- Task:
-- Rewrite Exercise 1 using a CTE called Order_Quantities.
--
-- The CTE should compute:
--   L_ORDERKEY,
--   Total_Quantity
--
-- Then select from the CTE to display the same result as Exercise 1.
--
-- Order the final output by L_ORDERKEY.








-- Exercise 3: Using a CTE to Simplify a Join
--
-- Task:
-- Starting from the Order_Quantities CTE from Exercise 2, join it to the ORDERS table
-- to display order-level details.
--
-- Display the following columns:
--   O_ORDERKEY,
--   O_ORDERDATE,
--   O_TOTALPRICE,
--   Total_Quantity
--
-- Order the results by O_TOTALPRICE descending.








-- Exercise 4: Medium Complexity (CTEs as Building Blocks)
--
-- Goal: Show how CTEs support layered reasoning.
--
-- Task:
-- Identify customers who tend to place large orders.
--
-- Steps:
--   1) Use a CTE (Order_Quantities) to compute Total_Quantity per order.
--   2) Join this CTE to ORDERS and CUSTOMER.
--   3) For each customer, compute:
--        • Avg_Order_Quantity = average Total_Quantity across their orders
--        • Order_Count        = number of orders placed
--
-- Display the following columns:
--   C_CUSTKEY,
--   C_FIRSTNAME,
--   C_LASTNAME,
--   Avg_Order_Quantity,
--   Order_Count
--
-- Filter to customers with more than 5 orders.
-- Order the results by Avg_Order_Quantity descending.








-- Exercise 5: Multiple CTEs instead of a complex subquery
--
-- Goal: Use several small CTEs as “building blocks” to answer a question that would
-- otherwise require a nested subquery (or a window function).
--
-- Task:
-- Identify “top customers” within each region based on total spending.
--
-- Definitions:
--   • Customer_Total_Spent = sum of O_TOTALPRICE across all orders for that customer
--   • A customer is considered a “top customer” in their region if their total spending
--     is greater than the average Customer_Total_Spent among customers in that same region.
--
-- CTE guidance:
--   1) Create a CTE (Customer_Regions) that maps each customer to their region:
--        CUSTOMER -> NATION -> REGION
--   2) Create a CTE (Customer_Spend) that computes Customer_Total_Spent per customer:
--        ORDERS grouped by O_CUSTKEY
--   3) Create a CTE (Customer_Spend_By_Region) that combines (1) and (2) so each row has:
--        customer info + region name + Customer_Total_Spent
--   4) Create a CTE (Region_Avg_Spend) that computes the average Customer_Total_Spent per region.
--   5) Join (3) to (4) and filter to customers whose Customer_Total_Spent is greater than their
--      region’s average.
--
-- Display the following columns:
--   R_NAME,
--   C_CUSTKEY,
--   C_FIRSTNAME,
--   C_LASTNAME,
--   Customer_Total_Spent,
--   Region_Avg_Spend
--
-- Order the results by R_NAME, then Customer_Total_Spent descending.
